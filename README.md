# Wodby

[Wodby](https://wodby.com) is a platform helping developers manage their server infrastructure and stacks. Wodby is not a hosting provider, we do not sell compute powers, instead you bring your own server/cluster from any cloud provider you want. We deploy, maintain infrastructure and stacks on your own server(s). 

The infrastructure we provide is strictly container-based and runs on Kubernetes and Docker. Our mission is to simplify the life of developers by automating most common tasks for infrastructure management and stacks maintenance. 

This repository contains the central issue tracker for the Wodby platform.

## Our name

Wodby pronounced as `wɔːdbi`. Wodby is a name of a water spirit in a slavic mythology (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vodyanoy). Vodyanoy or Wodby in Upper Sorbian language.

## Location

Wodby is a US corporation with a distributed team. Currently we provide support mostly in EU hours (CET). 

## Single-server setup and managed Kubernetes cluster

Because single-server and cluster infrastructure differ greatly, we make a big stress on this difference. Some of our stacks are suitable for cluster, some are not. You can read more about single-server infrastructure at https://help.wodby.com/infrastructure/single-server-infrastructure and about cluster at https://help.wodby.com/cluster
