# Wodby

[Wodby](https://wodby.com) is an applications management platform. We help developers deploy and manage their applications across any cloud. Wodby is not a hosting provider, we do not sell compute powers, instead you bring your own server/cluster from any cloud provider you want. We deploy, maintain infrastructure and stacks on your own server(s). 

The infrastructure we provide is strictly container-based and runs on Kubernetes and Docker. Our mission is to simplify the life of developers by automating most common tasks for infrastructure management and stacks maintenance. 

Wodby was founded in 2015 by [Pavel](https://github.com/PavelPrischepa) and [Chingis](https://github.com/csandanov) and backed by one of the most active Silicon Valley VCs [Plug and Play Ventures](https://www.plugandplaytechcenter.com/ventures).

## Our name

Wodby pronounced as `wɔːdbi`. Wodby is a name of a water spirit in a slavic mythology (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vodyanoy). Vodyanoy or Wodby in Upper Sorbian language.
