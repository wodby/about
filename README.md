# Wodby

[Wodby](https://wodby.com) is a platform helping developers manage their server infrastructure and stacks. Wodby is not a hosting provider, we do not sell compute powers, instead you bring your own server/cluster from any cloud provider you want. We deploy, maintain infrastructure and stacks on your own server(s). The infrastructure we provide is based mainly on Docker and Kubernetes. Our mission is to simplify and automate most common tasks for infrastructure management and stacks maintenance. 

This repository contains the central issue tracker for the Wodby platform.

## Single-server and cluster infrastructure

Because single-server and cluster infrastructure differ greatly, we make a big stress on this difference. Some of our stacks are suitable for cluster, some are not. You can read more about single-server infrastructure at https://docs.wodby.com/infrastructure/ and about cluster at https://docs.wodby.com/cluster

## Documentation
